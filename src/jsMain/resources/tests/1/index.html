        Hello! I'm a simple website.
        <h1>Test</h1>
        This website is infected by <a href="https://github.com/denis0001-dev/WebCorrupter.js">WebCorrupter.js</a>.
        That means this website will get corrupted really soon.
        <h2>What will happen</h2>
        The website will start glitching, text starts randomly switching colors, and more.
